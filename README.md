# Sortable Challenge

This is a Python application to complete the [Sortable.com coding challenge](http://sortable.com/challenge/).

I created this application mainly as an opportunity to learn Python. The code may not be spectacular, there might be a lot of ways seasoned Python developers might have done it differently, but this is the first Python application I wrote after the customary Hello World, so it's possible that with time and experience I might come back to refactor what I've done here.

Tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 on a standard Linux install.
